When I started my career in 2019 I thought I would become a backend developer but my interest in new tech and willingness to step up to a challenge, brought me into the world of Cloud-Native, DevOps and SRE. After having worked with DevOps for a while I got interested in the underlying infrastructure we built services on top of and this made me seek out new challenges in a startup, first as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer and then later as Cloud Architect and Tech.Lead. My experience has made me a supporter of cloud-native (albeit humbled), and I am a fierce opponent of complex tooling and complex documentation. My goal in my professional life is to make tools and systems that are easy to understand for developers and/or end-users.</p></div></div></div><hr><div class=resume-body><div class=row><div class="resume-main col-12 col-lg-8 col-xl-9 pr-0 pr-lg-5"><section class="work-section py-3"><h3 class="text-uppercase resume-section-heading mb-4">Work Experience</h3><div class="item mb-3"><div class="item-heading row align-items-center mb-2"><h4 class="item-title col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 mb-2 mb-md-0">Tech.
